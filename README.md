# HyperHeuristicKnapsack
Solving Knapsack Problem with several heuristick algorithms:
 * Simulated annealing
 * Genetic algorithm
 * Ant colony optimization

All these algorithms is united by machine learning algorithm 
(realisation: ?) which will detect the best one for solving problem 
with each input.
